1. Created git repo and cloned it in local
2. Create mycode.py (It will save a csv file to a new data folder)
3. Do a git add-commit-push before intiating the dvc
4. Install DVC using : pip install dvc (If not installed)
5. Now we will do "dvc init" (Creates .dvcignore,.dvc)

6. Now do "mkdir S3" (Creates a new S3 directory) # for now we are storing our data version locally
NOTE : jitne baar bhi apna code version save kr rhe hai then apna data ko bhi save
        krna hta hai for that version using dvc and hume location batana padta 
        hai dvc ko ki tum iss location pr data version save karo

7. Now we do "dvc remote add -d myremote S3" (S3 because it local folder, URL if using S3 on AWS)
8. Next we do "dvc add data/" (this means ki dvc abse jo bhi changes tum dekho data folder mein usko versioning ke liye tum dhyn do)
    Above line command i.e. "dvc add data/" will give an error as it's currently being track by git
    so we will remove this tracking by git and give it to dvc to handle it.
    Run code shown in error and then again run "dvc add data/"

9. Again we do "dvc add data/" (creates data.dvc) then "git add .gitignore data.dvc"
10. Now "dvc commit" and then "dvc push"
11. Do a git add-commit-push to mark this stage as first version of data
12. Now make changes to mycode.py to append a new row of data, check changes via "dvc status"
13. Again "dvc commit" and "dvc push"
14. Then git add-commit-push (we are saving version 2 of our data at this point)
15. Check dvc/git status, everything should be upto date
16. Now repeat step 12-14 for version 3 of data


Now let's say we want to rollback to our first version of data
so we will do:
1. git log --oneline (to get sha id for our first version of data commit)
2. git checkout <sha id> - git checkout master
3. dvc pull
